### :fish: How do I spend my time?

I use data to explore and visualize Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and other transdisciplinarity research at Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions. I also enjoy supporting scientists on their journeys navigating open-science, reproducible workflows, and data management.

### 🪴 I'm interested in: 

Beautiful data viz, machine learning, AI, APIs, git, command line, webscraping, software development, geospatial analysis, scalable computing & more 

### 🗺️ I come from: 

A background in environmental science, water quality, and marine ecology research with plenty of muddy and fishy field experience.
