Research Data Analyst @ [Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions](https://oceansolutions.stanford.edu/)

### :fish: How do I spend my time?

I use data to explore and vizualize Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and other transdisciplinarity research at Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions. I also enjoy supporting scientists in their open-science and data management journeys through formal and informal conversations about concepts, tools, and workflows. 

### ðŸª´ I'm building my skills in: 

APIs, writing R packages, git, command line, shiny, webscraping, geospatial analysis, python, scalable computing & more
