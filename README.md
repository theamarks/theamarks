<h1 align="center"> Hello! 🔆 I'm Althea Marks </h1>

<h3 align="center"> Data Science Fellow @ Arctic Data Center </h3>
<br>

### ⏳ How do I spend my time?

I currently contribute to the open science community by improving tools to give credit to people who create and openly share datasets. I am improving ([tools](https://github.com/theamarks/scythe)) to search for and record dataset citations in digital libraries. Tracing dataset citations allows data creators to recieve credit for their contributions and understand how their data is reused.
