### 🪴 How do I spend my time?

I currently contribute to the open science community by improving tools to give credit to people who create and openly share datasets. I am improving [an](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/152/when-should-i-use-a-vs-an) R [package](https://github.com/theamarks/scythe) to search for dataset citations in digital libraries. Attribution of datasets to their creators allows data creators to recieve credit for their work, understand the broader impact of sharing their data, and trace how their data is reused. 

### 🏗️ I'm building my skills in: 

API querries, writing R packages, Git, Unix shell, Shiny, webscraping, geospatial analysis, parallel computing & more
